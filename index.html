          <h3>Launchcode - St. Louis, MO</h3>
          <p>LC101 Graduate, 2001</p>
          <p>As I completed a challenging and rigorous, comprehensive, 20 week web developer training course, I was also an indispensable mentor for multiple students, dedicated to many extra hours coaching them across the finish line. The focus of the program was excelling at building full-stack web applications with in demand technologies, such as JavaScript, Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and frameworks such as Spring and Angular. I branched out to additionally learn React, MongoDB, Docker and become familiar with features available in the latest releases.</p>
